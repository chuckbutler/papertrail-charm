#Papertrail Charm



Overview
--------

This charm provides Papertrailapp logging from [Papertrail](http://www.papertrailapp.com). Papertrail provides instant log visibility. Use Papertrail's time-saving log tools, flexible system groups, team-wide access, long-term archives, charts and analytics exports, monitoring webhooks, and 45-second setup to ship your rsyslog logs, application output, and much more to Papertrail's logging service.

Usage
-----


    juju deploy papertrail

and so on. If you're providing a web service or something that the end user needs to go to, tell them here, especially if you're deploying a service that might listen to a non-default port.

You can then browse to http://ip-address to configure the service.

Configuration
-------------


The configuration options will be listed on the charm store, however If you're making assumptions or opinionated decisions in the charm (like setting a default administrator password), you should detail that here so the user knows how to change it immediately, etc.
